Chess for Success</span></h2>
<h3>Event Coordinator, 2013</h3>
    <p class="lead">I worked with Chess for Success as event coordinator for their annual fundraising auction <em>A Knight to Remember</em> to develop messaging, publications, and other communications and marketing tools and materials. Each of the invitation design samples are used as themes to carry through all other related publications. The 2013 design is my original work depicting a lion chess peice.</p>
    <p class="lead">I developed and implemented an evaluation plan to analyze the outcomes of the event. The final evaluation resulted in a strategic marketing and stewardship plan.</p>
