  As VP of Communications on the board for the student chapter of the <a href="http://www.afporegon.afpnet.org/content.cfm?ContentItemID=52869&navItemNumber=5318">Association of Fundraising Professionals</a>, I conducted a number of user group analysis with co-organizers and group members to determine the best structure and organization of information online.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  Using this information, I designed and implemented a website using <a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com/">DrupalGardens</a> which ensured future student leaders would be able to maintain the site even if they didn't know how to write code.
