  I supervised a 50-person AmeriCorps team tutoring elementary school students to read across 10 different schools spread across six counties in Washington state.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  As their coach, mentor, and supervisor, I supported members to achieve personal and professional goals. This included planning and implementing member orientation, training, and team building activities.

  <p class="lead">
    I created this blog in response to a national initiative to have a stronger on line presence for the program and as a tool to communicate with the community, other members, and state and federal AmeriCorps agencies what our team was doing.
  </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I helped members write about their experiences as reading tutors so the content was always fresh and meaningful.  While it is noticeably out of date, you can get an idea of what it was.
