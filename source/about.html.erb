            <h4>Tech education is about empowering others to transform their lives.</h4>
              <p class="blog-inpic"> <img src="img/tech-education.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 45px;">After getting my masters in public administration and nonprofit management, I began thinking about how technology could help so many nonprofits expand their reach and impact to benefit communities. I wanted to be an educational resource and a point of access to tech knowledge for nonprofits.</p>
              <p>I began this effort by co-founding a code school and then became a co-organizer for Code for Portland and an education specialist for New Relic. As I continue to explore this field, I am excited to find new ways to be a bridge and a resource for others to access technology.</p>
